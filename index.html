        <ul>

        <li>O Allah, I seek refuge in Thee from four things: Knowledge which does not profit, a heart which is not submissive, a soul which has an insatiable appetite, and a supplication which is not heard. </li>
        <li>Allahummah Ameen </li>
            
        </ul>

       As a muslim i strongly believe that the weapond of a believer is Dua, so i try my best and pray constantly. I seek Allah's guidance to make it easy for me while i entrust my self to him whole heartely.
